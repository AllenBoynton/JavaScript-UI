He's always dignified, never shy or vicious. Mastiffs love children. That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. They're best suited to homes with older children. He makes a fine companion for anyone who can accommodate his great size and doesn't mind a little drool slung here and there.",
					personality: "Mastiffs dislike conflict between family members as well and will step between arguing spouses or a parent punishing a child. While he might look tough on the outside, the Mastiff is a sensitive dog that can become shy, fearful, or aggressive if mishandled.
